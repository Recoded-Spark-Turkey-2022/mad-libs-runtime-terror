One day Nour[n] and Rabia[n] decided it would be cool[a] to walk[v] through a restaurant[n].
 When they got in the restaurant[n] they saw blod[n] puddles on the floor. They got really scared[a] 
 and ran into a room. Then a beautiful[a] halloween creature jumped[v] out and yelled, "Boo!"
They saw out of the restaurant[n] and saw an hand[n] lying on the ground. They ran[v] all the way to a dormitories[n]. When they got there their phone, Omer[n], told them it was he who had scared them.

"Boo!" they said, "You really gave us a scare."
